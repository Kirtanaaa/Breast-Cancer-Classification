# Breast-Cancer-Classification
## Overview

This project focuses on utilizing various classification models to accurately classify breast cancer cases, aiding in early detection and personalized treatment.

## Classification Models Used

1. Logistic Regression Classification Model:
   
   Accuracy: 0.964
   
   Description: Logistic regression is a machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to predict one of       two possible classes 

2. KNN Classification Model:
   
   Accuracy: 0.959
   
   Description: K-Nearest Neighbors is a simple yet powerful classification algorithm used in supervised machine learning. It's a type of           instance-based learning, where the algorithm doesn't build an explicit model but instead memorizes the training dataset. KNN makes
   predictions based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbours in the feature space.

3. Support Vector Machine Classification Model:
   
   Accuracy: 0.935
   
   Description: Support Vector Machines are powerful and versatile machine learning algorithms commonly used for both classification and
   regression tasks. They belong to the family of supervised learning algorithms, meaning they require labeled data for training. SVMs are
   particularly well-suited for cases where the data isn't linearly separable in its original feature space. They work by finding a hyperplane
   that best separates different classes of data points while maximizing the margin between them.
   
4. Kernal Support Vector Machine Classification Model:
   
   Accuracy: 0.970
   
   Description: A Kernel SVM is an enhancement of the traditional SVM that introduces the concept of kernel functions. These functions allow the
   SVM to transform the original feature space into a higher-dimensional space where the data might become linearly separable. This
   transformation enables the SVM to handle complex, non-linear relationships between features.

5. Naive Bayes Classification Model:
    
   Accuracy: 0.964
   
   Description: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, with the "naive" assumption of independence
   between features. Despite this assumption, Naive Bayes often performs surprisingly well in practice and is widely used in various
   applications like text classification, spam filtering, and sentiment analysis.

6. Random Forest Classification Model:
    
   Accuracy: 0.947
   
   Description: Random Forest is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to create a more robust and accurate
   classification model. It's designed to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization performance of individual decision trees.


## Conclusion

The findings underscore that the Kernel Support Vector Machine Classification Model excels among the employed classification models, achieving a commendable accuracy score of 0.970. It furnishes a dependable forecast for breast cancer classification based on the provided features. Additionally, the Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Random Forest models showcase competitive performance. 

This study illuminates the significance of employing diverse models to pinpoint the optimal classification approach for breast cancer analysis, contributing to improved detection and treatment.
